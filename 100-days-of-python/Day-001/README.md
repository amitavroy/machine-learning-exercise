# Day 01

Some of the Python stuff is very similar to PHP. Some points that I want to note:

1. the `print` function can take multiple arguments very similar to the JS console.log
1. concatination is very similar to how PHP and JS works
1. Escaping works the same. However, the tripe quote for escape is quite nice
1. The backslash is a very useful operator for strings
1. Raw string can be done using 'r'
