    "Service providers are the central place of all Laravel application bootstrapping. Your own application, as well as all of Laravel's core services, are bootstrapped via service providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what do we mean by \"bootstrapped\"? In general, we mean registering things, including registering service container bindings, event listeners, middleware, and even routes. Service providers are the central place to configure your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open the config/app.php file included with Laravel, you will see a providers array. These are all of the service provider classes that will be loaded for your application. By default, a set of Laravel core service providers are listed in this array. These providers bootstrap the core Laravel components, such as the mailer, queue, cache, and others. Many of these providers are \"deferred\" providers, meaning they will not be loaded on every request, but only when the services they provide are actually needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this overview, you will learn how to write your own service providers and register them with your Laravel application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Service Providers\n",
    "All service providers extend the Illuminate\\Support\\ServiceProvider class. Most service providers contain a register and a boot method. Within the register method, you should only bind things into the service container. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the register method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Artisan CLI can generate a new provider via the make:provider command:\n",
    "\n",
    "php artisan make:provider RiakServiceProvider\n",

    "The Register Method\n",
    "As mentioned previously, within the register method, you should only bind things into the service container. You should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the register method. Otherwise, you may accidentally use a service that is provided by a service provider which has not loaded yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a basic service provider. Within any of your service provider methods, you always have access to the $app property which provides access to the service container:\n",
    "\n",
    "<?php\n",
    " \n",
    "namespace App\\Providers;\n",
    " \n",
    "use App\\Services\\Riak\\Connection;\n",
    "use Illuminate\\Contracts\\Foundation\\Application;\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        $this->app->singleton(Connection::class, function (Application $app) {\n",

    "}\n",

    "This service provider only defines a register method, and uses that method to define an implementation of App\\Services\\Riak\\Connection in the service container. If you're not yet familiar with Laravel's service container, check out its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bindings and singletons Properties\n",
    "If your service provider registers many simple bindings, you may wish to use the bindings and singletons properties instead of manually registering each container binding. When the service provider is loaded by the framework, it will automatically check for these properties and register their bindings:\n",
    "\n",

By default, a set of Laravel core service providers are registered in this array. The default providers bootstrap the core Laravel components, such as the mailer, queue, cache, and others.\n",

Deferring the loading of such a provider will improve the performance of your application, since it is not loaded from the filesystem on every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laravel compiles and stores a list of all of the services supplied by deferred service providers, along with the name of its service provider class. Then, only when you attempt to resolve one of these services does Laravel load the service provider.\n",
    "\n",
