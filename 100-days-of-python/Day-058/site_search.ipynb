Among its standout features, one that truly captures the spotlight is its remarkable ability to construct a standalone and self-contained binary. This particular feature holds immense significance, particularly in the realm of shipping PHP applications to production.',\n",
       "  'FrankenPHP is a modern PHP app server written in Go. Here are some points which really sets it apart from others in the race',\n",

       "  'Written in Go and C, it relies on Go’s iconic goroutines features',\n",
       "  'It uses Caddy server under the hood. So, HTTPS support for local development is also available out of the box',\n",

These aren't just perks; they're the kind that can genuinely shake up your development and deployment game.\",\n",
       "  'Single binary - Deployment Bliss',\n",
       "  \"Ever dreamed of simplifying your deployment process? FrankenPHP makes it happen. The ability to whip up a single binary for our entire PHP application is a game-changer. No need for additional software – just a straightforward Ubuntu docker container is all you require to run your PHP apps. This not only streamlines deployment but also trims down the docker container's size on production. Less software onboard means fewer attack vectors, and trust me, that's a security win we all want.Worker Script Mode - Powering Up Performance\",\n",
       "  \"Let's talk about performance, shall we? One of the cool things about Node applications is their ability to run entirely from memory, providing a performance boost for high-traffic scenarios. Guess what? FrankenPHP brings that magic to PHP using its worker mode. Boot up once, stay in memory, and enjoy a significant performance boost. It's the kind of wizardry that keeps your app nimble and ready for action.\",\n",

Now, I see how it can turbocharge a site's speed, especially in today's SEO landscape where page speed is king. FrankenPHP claims a whopping 30% reduction in loading time by harnessing early hint support. Curious? Dive into the MDN docs for the full scoop on how this feature works wonders.\",\n",
